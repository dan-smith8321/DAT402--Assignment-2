DAT 402- Visualisation
For my Data Visualisation I decided to create a visualisation where it shows converted data used from a table I referenced using my code. This data used is showing the earthquake data from all around the world from the past month and the data is updated every 5mins. So if a new earthquake happens the data will update and it will show on my visualisation. I've also used ellipses to show the data on the world map I've got from using an api, the ellipses also show bigger depending on the magnitude of the earthquake.
